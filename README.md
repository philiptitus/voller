# VollerAi - AI-Powered Data Analyst for Kenya's Current Issues

VollerAi is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered data analysis tool that harnesses Instagram's Graph API to gather data from trusted news accounts in Kenya. The goal is to filter and analyze the data to focus on current issues affecting Kenya such as employment, financial trends, climate change, and other critical social-economic topics. 

By utilizing cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and data processing techniques, VollerAi helps identify key issues, predict trends, and provide actionable insights for individuals, policymakers, and organizations alike. The project also tracks financial usage by the Kenyan government and delivers educational courses based on the gathered data to help citizens stay informed about their country's most pressing issues.

## Project Status: **Work In Progress** ⚠️

While VollerAi is not fully complete, its foundation is strong, and it shows immense potential. Further refinement and development will allow VollerAi to become a powerful AI-based data analysis tool that can serve a variety of needs in Kenya, such as forecasting trends and creating public awareness on key issues.
